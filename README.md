Do you have some trust issue because of suspicious mod ?

Don't worry, you can check through the source code and even build the mod yourself, here's the steps :
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/PigmanYT3531/minecraft-vine-boom.git`
2. Run `cd minecraft-vine-boom` and run `sudo chmod -x gradlew` to give `gradlew` executable permission
3. Run `./gradlew build` to build the mod

Notes for windows user :
1. You don't need to give executable permission on Windows, but you have to change directory before building
2. On Windows, the command is `gradlew build`

The Windows instruction probably incorrect because i'm not using Windows anymore
